# Secretary Problem
The Secretary problem gives an indication on how to trade between the time to explore data and exploiting. The stylized problem aims to select the very best secretary in the pool of secretaries. Assuming they arrive one **t** the time and randomly about qualifications, an optimal strategy is to explore about the first one third of candidates and the exploit on the first thereafter arriving outdoing the best candidate in the explored pool.

This problem does not involve a downloadable dataSet, so can be recreated using the supplied code.
